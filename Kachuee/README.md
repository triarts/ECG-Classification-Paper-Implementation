# Paper Implementation
Description: This is implementation of paper from M. Kachuee et al. "ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation" [(source)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00794)
* Dataset from kaggle: [(source)](https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)

This code was implemented using tensorflow with keras API

### TODO next
- [x] implementation using dataset from kaggle (MITDB)
- [ ] implementation transfer learning for PTB (MI disease) dataset
- [ ] implementation using MITBIH dataset (selfmade implementation preprocessing method based on paper)
- [ ] Add selfmade prepreocessing method
